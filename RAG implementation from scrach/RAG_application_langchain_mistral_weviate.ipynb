As of now, IIT Bhilai is under construction and not yet operational. However, I can provide you with a general idea of the registration process for IITs based on the current processes in other IITs.\\n\\n1. Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main: To be eligible for admission into IITs, you need to appear for the JEE Main exam conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA).\\n\\n2. Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA): Based on your JEE Main rank, you can participate in the JoSAA counseling process to choose your preferred IIT and course.\\n\\n3. Registration: During the JoSAA counseling process, you will be required to register on the JoSAA website using your JEE Main roll number and other necessary details.\\n\\n4. Choice Filling and Locking: After registration, you can fill in your preferred choices of IITs and courses in order of preference. Make sure to lock your choices before the deadline.\\n\\n5. Seat Allocation: Based on the seat availability, your rank, and the choices filled, you will be allocated a seat in an IIT.\\n\\n6. Document Verification and Fee Payment: After seat allocation, you will be required to report to the allotted IIT for document verification and fee payment. Bring original documents and photocopies for verification.\\n\\n7. Admission Confirmation: Once your documents are verified and the fee is paid, you will receive an admission letter confirming your seat in the IIT.\\n\\n8. Registration at the IIT: After joining, you will be required to complete the registration process at the IIT, which may include biometric data collection, course selection, and other formalities.\""
